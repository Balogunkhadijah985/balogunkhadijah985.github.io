<center><u>MY ACHIVEMENT</u></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My achievement started in JSS 2 
when I got myself involved in a UBA writing competition.I loved writing letters,scripts and songs.
Writing has been my thing.I was happy to submit my write-up waiting to receive a good news
which I did.I was called for the final competition which I attended with my father.I surprised 
everyone at the competition by making my school,teachers and parents proud.I was given lots of awards
which encourage me for the better tomorrow.I was happy hearing people using me as a good example to my juniors
and people consulting me to explain things for them.I became a writer at the age of 24,I publish books too,to satisfy
human needs.Now Iam happily married with 3 lovely kids.Writing!Writing!Writing,the mood I enjoy.It makes me happy.
